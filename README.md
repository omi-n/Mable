# This project is currently a (VERY) early work in progress.


Mable is a work-in-progress discord bot made for my personal use.

If you want to use it, go right ahead. Just host it yourself.


You can do this by:

-going to the discord developer portal

-create application

-add bot

-copy the token

-paste the token and a prefix you want into a new file called 'config.json'

-go to discord developers api helper

-manage permissions as needed (admin if you're lazy)

-invite

-install nodeJS+npm and add all the dependencies it tells you to


There are many illogical features that may not seem very useful.

## Planned Features / To do


IMPORTANT: rewriting scraper.
