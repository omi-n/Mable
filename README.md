# This project is currently a (VERY) early work in progress.

Mable is a work-in-progress discord bot made for my personal use.

If you want to use it, go right ahead. Just host it yourself.


You can do this by:

-going to the discord developer portal

-create application
-add bot

-copy the token

-paste the token and a prefix you want into config

-go to discord developers api helper

-manage permissions as needed (admin if you're lazy)

-invite and use it


There are many illogical features that may not seem very useful.

## Planned Features / To do

Math operation compatibility with numbers.js

Compatibility with any scraper that can output to a JSON file.

Price Checkers for certain items on Newegg and Amazon.

Server management features (like every other discord bot)!

Music.

fix aliases (oops)
